<div class="container">
  This is my little project to learn AngularJS and figure out how to do things like dynamic injection of directives, custom filters, and binding event listeners.  Some features are just stubbed out with placeholders as I'm sure you've noticed ... *cough* ... login authentication.  Hopefully, I'll get to everything eventually as time permits.
